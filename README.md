## ðŸ“– Project Goal

-> The project aimed to enhance the classification performance of 19 White Blood Cells (WBC) classes by solving the imbalance problem in the original dataset. The specific types of WBCs to be classified are as follows: Band_neutrophil, Segmented_neutrophil, Eosinophil, Basophil, Lymphocyte, Promyelocyte, Myelocyte, Metamyelocyte, Prolymphocyte, Immature_cell, Lymphocyte_variant_form, Plasma_cell, Large_granular_lymphocyte, Abnormal_cell, Smudge_cell, Artifact, nRBC, and Giant_platelet.

->  On solving the problem of imbalanced data volume in those types of white blood cells, we introduced a generative model - Diffusion-based Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network with Gradient Penalty (WGAN-GP) that contributed to having a balanced training dataset which helped the training and generalization of the combined ResNet50 and Support Vector Machine (SVM) for the classification task.

## ðŸ“– Data Summary

-> The dataset contains 3,914 generated images of various types of white blood cells (JPEG). This dataset is divided into 19 different white blood cell types (classes) generated by the proposed diffusion-based WGAN-GP generative model as an augmentation procedure to enhance white blood cell classification.

-> The 19 different types of White Blood Cells (WBCs) are Band_neutrophil, Segmented_neutrophil, Eosinophil, Basophil, Lymphocyte, Promyelocyte, Myelocyte, Metamyelocyte, Prolymphocyte, Immature_cell, Lymphocyte_variant_form, Plasma_cell, Large_granular_lymphocyte, Abnormal_cell, Smudge_cell, Artifact, nRBC, and Giant_platelet.
