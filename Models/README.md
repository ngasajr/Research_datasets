# White_Blood_cells Classification
The dataset contains 3,914 generated images of various types of white blood cells (JPEG). This dataset is divided into 19 different white blood cell types (classes) generated by the proposed diffusion-based WGAN-GP generative model as an augmentation procedure to enhance white blood cell classification.

The 19 different types of White Blood Cells (WBCs) are Band_neutrophil, Segmented_neutrophil, Eosinophil, Basophil, Lymphocyte, Promyelocyte, Myelocyte, Metamyelocyte, Prolymphocyte, Immature_cell, Lymphocyte_variant_form, Plasma_cell, Large_granular_lymphocyte, Abnormal_cell, Smudge_cell, Artifact, nRBC, and Giant_platelet.
